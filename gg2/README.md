# Getting Git
[Getting Git](https://gettinggit.com) is an affordable and comprehensive video course from `git init` to *Git Master*.

This repository is used in *Part 4 - Sharing Work* to allow viewers to sign the [registry](registry.txt) and leave a [testimonial](testimonials.md). In doing so, viewers learn Git commands like `git push` and `git pull`, as well as familiarize themselves with GitHub's workflows like *forking* repositories and creating *Pull Requests*.

In addition, most of the video transcripts have been adapted into posts so everyone may [learn Git](https://gettinggit.com/learn).
